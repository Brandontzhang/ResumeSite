                    While I do spend a lot of time studying computer science, I have spent a lot of the last 3 years learning how to ballroom dance.
                    I joined Northeasternâ€™s ballroom dance club in my first year with almost no experience because of a dance class I had taken in high
                    school, a decision which has shaped my time at Northeastern. I have not only gained a skill that I never thought that I would have,
                    I have also met and befriended people in the ballroom community from all around Boston
